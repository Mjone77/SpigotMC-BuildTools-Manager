# SpigotMC BuildTools Manager
Provides a simple interface for interacting with SpigotMC's BuildTools.

## Features
* Easy to use: Just double-click to run
* Asks user for which versio of Spigot to build, then builds that version
* Automatically downloads the latest version of BuildTools if it is not already in the same folder as the manager is ran.
* No dependencies

## Usage
To use, simply double click the SpigotBuildToolsManager.bat file and follow the prompts. This will generate a lot of files and directories so it is best to place it in its own folder first.

## Troubleshooting
The portable git instillation performed by BuildTools will fail if the working directory path contains a space.
